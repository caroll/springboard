#!/usr/bin/env bash

# 1 What does the man command do? Type in man rm. How do you scroll and get out?
# shows the manual for the command, with all the details about what it does and all its flags
# to get out use the "q" key (quit)
# use the up and down arrows to scroll, page up and page down also works but there is no in between

# 2 Look at the man page for ls. What does the -l flag do? What does the -a flag do?
# -l show a long listing format, or shows each file/folder in one line and each of them with some extra details,
# as owner, group, permissions, etc.
# -a make sure to show all files, even the hidden ones

# 3 How do you jump between words in the terminal? (I use Linux, Debian)
# alt + f = 1 word forward
# alt + b = 1 word back

# 4 How do you get to the end of a line in terminal?
# ctrl + e = end of line

# 5 How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal?
# ctrl + a = beginning of line

# 6 How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in terminal?
# ctrl + w = delete word to the left
# alt + d = delete word to the right

# 7 What is the difference between a terminal and shell?
# Terminal is the program/software where the computer shell runs
# Shell is the layer between the user and the Operational System, where we can interact with the SO

# 8 What is an absolute path?
# Absolute path is the full path name of a file/folder, starting from the root directory, so does not 
# matter where you're in the filesystem, you'll always be able to find it.
# Ex.: /home/caroll/sandbox/github/springboard-repos/snippets/terminal-exercise/part-2.txt

# 9. What is an relative path?
# Relative path name represents a file/folder based (with the starting point) on the current working directory.
# Ex.: terminal-exercise/part-2.txt or ../terminal-exercise/part-2.txt

# 10. What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.
# --help short version of the man (not all applications have, but it's useful)
# cp -r <orig-folder> <dest-folder> where -r copies all the content inside of the original folder "recursively" 
# -v verbose, to show in the terminal what is happening, step-by-step

#11. What do the r and f flags do with the rm command?
# r removes recursively, if it's a folder, all files and other folders inside it will be deleted too.
# f force, do anything we asked for without questioning, even when we do dumb sh*t.
