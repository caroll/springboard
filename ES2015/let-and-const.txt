What is the difference between var and let?
- We can reassign and redeclare var, but let we can just reassign, never redeclare;
- Depending on the scope, var can be a risk, it creates a hoisted variable. Lets has block scope.

What is the difference between var and const?
-- We can reassign and redeclare var, const don't let us do neither;
-- Const also has only block scope.

What is the difference between let and const?
-- Let can be reassigned and const can't.

What is hoisting?
-- It's how JS behaves, moving all variable declarations (functions too) to the top of their scope and initializing them.
-- Just var declarations behave this way, we can avoid this using let and const. They are also moved to the top, but they are not initialized.
