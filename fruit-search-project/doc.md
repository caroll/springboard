# Fruit search 

## step 1

What type of JavaScript event listeners would you need to add to refresh the drop-down as a user types?

* event listener: keyup

How would you populate the search bar with an option from the drop down list? What event would trigger this action?

* a click or enter probably
The click was the easy choice here, but I believe that the field should be another kind of input to use enter and be easier to navigate via keyboard.

* setting the input value = list item selected

## step 2 Read the Starter Code
* added some CSS (html, body and an extra wrap for positioning the search field)
* fixed the CSS and JS paths
    
## step 3 Create search bar in the screen
* it was already there

## step 4 Add Placeholder Text Into The Search Bar
* it was already in place

## step 5 Add An Event Listener For Key Strokes
* I'm using keyup

## step 6 Filter The List Based On User Input
* search is case insensitive
* it's an array, but maybe I should have converted it to a Set
* I'm using regex

## step 7 Display The Results List As A Drop Down 
* creates the suggestion list

## step 8 Highlight the suggestion below a user’s cursor
* It's done in CSS (I think that's easier), but I commented it and
* added as an event listener to the js file using mouseover and mouseout to replicate
* the hover action

## step 9 Populate the search box with a user’s selected suggestion
* Used the event information passed as param

## step 10 Style the page 
* added gradient background with custom colors
* added some style for the input and suggestion list
